```

## Usage

This library provides functions to calculate solar time, also known as local apparent time, based on a given location and date.

Solar time is important for various applications such as astronomy, navigation, and solar energy systems.

By using this library, you can accurately determine the position of the sun in the sky for any given time and place, accounting for factors such as the Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt.  
This is crucial for tasks that require precise solar positioning, such as optimizing solar panel orientation, planning astronomical observations, or navigating by the sun.
